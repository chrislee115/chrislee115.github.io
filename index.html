                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h3 class="about-me-text">I was born in Troy, MI and went to Warren Consolidated Schools. Then right after 6th grade, we moved far - to the other side of Troy, MI, where I went to Troy School District. Somewhere along the way, I picked up a strong fascination with computer science (probably because I thought computer science = gaming), and I've carried that passion for the field ever since.
                    <br><br>
                    In high school, I tried to push myself to learn cybersecurity through various CTFs and websites or learn programming through Codeacademy but I couldn't find the motivation to keep going when I couldn't figure something out - no one else around me had any knowledge in the field (I've become much better at Googling problems since then). Because of this ordeal, it became a really easy decision to enroll at the Univesity of Michigan to study Computer Science.
                    <br><br>
                    My time here at UM has been wonderful thus far - programming is now a way for me to create products that can provide actual benefit to people as opposed to a "hello world" hat trick, I am now understanding all different stacks of technology and how I can apply them to future projects instead of tunneling on trying to create the next Flappy Bird, and most importantly, I now know how to code websites as opposed to inspecting element on various pages and changing text to "butt."  
                    <br><br>
                    Wherever the road takes me, I hope theres good food and tea.

                    <h3>In Progress</h3>
                    <h3 class="project-text">I recently decided to pursue a double major in Computer Science and Data Science, so I was figuring out which requirements I needed to graduate and I found the process to be rather tedious. I would have to open an excel sheet and like fifty tabs to look up major requirements, what types of credits a course gave, course ratings, etc. So I started working on a course planner with a good friend of mine to try to package all these things into a website!<br><br>
                    To use it, a user would download their transcript and upload it to our site so we can analyze which credits have been completed. Then the user selects a major and is able to look up and add courses that will satisfy their major requirements to their college plan. We're writing this in Python, using Django framework for the site, Selenium for scraping course information, and Poppler for converting the transcripts.<br>

                    <h3>COVID Summer Aug 2020</h3>
                    <h3 class="project-text">
                        At the beginning of the year, we have a festival in the fall - Festifall - where student orgs try to woo other students to join their organizations. With Festifall going virtual due to the lovely COVID, I wanted to help keep FunKtion's spirit alive so I attempted to revamp our website! (not sure where the old one went tbh)
                        <br><br>
                        A group of ~5 other members wanted to help out as well, so I broke them up into different aspects of website creation - design/programming/hosting. and we cranked out the website in about a month's time! <br>

                    <h3>Jan - Mar 2020</h3>
                    <h3 class="project-text">
                        Many people complain about the bus app that the university provides (i.e. complaints about ui/buses disappear), so I tried to create an app that would attempt to alleviate some of these problems and add additional features (particularly for android users).
                        <br><br>
                        At the time, I recently switched to a Pixel 3 (dropped the iPhone in a river oops). I really liked the control center at the top and noticed that 3rd party apps can also add their own icons. 
                        I tried to run with this idea - when you clicked the MBus Notifier icon, it would begin looking at a users location and inform the user of nearby bus stops/incoming buses. A user would have been able to filter out buses or favorite buses so they could get a notification when their bus is almost arriving.
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, while I was developing the app, COVID began to break out and everything started switching to their virtual counterparts, so I decided to put this project on hold until public transportation becomes a safe and viable option.<br>

                    <h3 class="project-text">This is a smart "mirror" I made on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. To use it, I would turn on the Raspberry Pi when I wake up, then go brush my teeth or something while the Pi boots up (~40 sec). When I come back, I can see what I have to do for the day! I used Google Calendar, OpenWeathermap, Spotify (not pictured) to show current/upcoming events, weather, and the song title/artist that was playing from my Spotify at the time!<br><br> I had no idea where to begin, so I figured I would learn from example - I cloned some guy's git repo and looked at how the pieces came together. The concept was basic enough, but his code was <i>interesting</i>, to say the least, so I rewrote the whole thing. It's still quite poorly written as I didn't quite package it up nicely, but oh well, live and learn.<br>
